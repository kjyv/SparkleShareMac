# SparkleShare Mac

[![Xcode - Build and Analyze](https://github.com/kjyv/SparkleShareMac/actions/workflows/build-analyze-xcode.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kjyv/SparkleShareMac/actions/workflows/build-analyze-xcode.yml)

This is a simple attempt on implementing the basic functionality of https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/
as a native macOS application since the original C# app is not maintained anymore.
