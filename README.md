# SparkleShare Mac

[![Xcode - Build and Analyze](https://github.com/kjyv/SparkleShareMac/actions/workflows/build-analyze-xcode.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kjyv/SparkleShareMac/actions/workflows/build-analyze-xcode.yml)

This is a simple clone that covers the basic functionality of https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/
as a native macOS application. As the original C# app is not maintained anymore and building it has become more complicated
with Microsoft discontinuing Visual Studio for Mac, this is possibly a more future proof way of syncing SparkleShare repositories on macOS.
